Tic Tac Toe
In start , game will ask player 1 to choose his/her sign. Player 2's sign will automatically be assigned.

Then Game will initiate with random start , every time , there would be a random starting player , either player 1 or player 2.
then on any tile , player clicks , that tile will be assigned that sign , at every click check that if there are any three same signs in a row , or a diagonal. then the player with that sign wins the game , and create a leaderboard storing wins and loss of every player in a session.



Note 1 - Check display:inline-table property & make use of that while making score board.

Update 1 - HTML is made with developer CSS expect for Leader Board.

Algorithm For watching the winning side = 
	 make two arrays -> player1 array & player2 array
	 assuming that array is sized 1-9 , at every grid pos , put a "1" at every place where a players places its mark.
	 rest all the places should remain 0.
	 At every click check for all possible permutations and combinations. 
	 [
	 	0:
	 	1:
	 	2:
	 	3:
	 	4:
	 	5:
	 	6:
	 	7:
	 	8:
	 	9:
	 ];
	 put 1 at every index position , which ever position is marked by player.
	 at every click check , if the possible permutations are there.
	 Possible permutations are ->
	 [123],[213],[312],[132],[231],[321]
	 [147],[174],[417],[471],[714],[741]
	 [159],[195],[519],[591],[915],[951]
	 [456],[465],[546],[564],[645],[654]
	 [789],[798],[879],[897],[978],[987]
	 [258],[285],[528],[582],[852],[825]
	 [369],[396],[639],[693],[936],[963]


	 if any one is true , that person wins the game.

	 STATUS - Algorithm has been made & implemented.


	 TODO - Tic TAc gameplay area. Set specific thick borders to show seperate blocks. hide all other borders.

	 style the bar at the top. 
	 write JavaScript Code To display player markers at all times & don't change throughout the course of game.
